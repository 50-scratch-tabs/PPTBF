<h3>Propose Projects To Be Featured</h3>
  <p>PPTBF (Propose Projects To Be Featured) is a Scratch studio run by the Scratch Team and curated by volunteers, for Scratchers to suggest a project to be featured.</p>
  <p>The studio can be found <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/28715018">here</a>, and anyone can propose projects in <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/28715018/comments">comments section</a>.</p>
  <p>There are only two rules for proposing. (Well, really three, but the last one shouldn't need to be said)</p>
  <ol>
    <li><a href="rules/scratcher.html">The user proposing the project must be a Scratcher.</a></li>
    <li><a href="rules/no_propose_own.html">Users cannot propose projects created by them.</a></li>
    <li>Projects must follow the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/community_guidelines">Scratch Community Guidelines</a>. (duh)</li>
  </ol>
